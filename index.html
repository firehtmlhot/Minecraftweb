                We present to your attention the
                announcement of the upcoming update for
                Minecraft Bedrock 1.17.0 for Android! Most
                recently, developer Mojang held a very
                significant event called Minecraft Live
                2020, which presented new innovations that
                will be added to the Minecraft world in the
                Minecraft PE 1.17 update.<br>
                At Minecraft Live 2020, the developers
                announced the Caves &amp; Cliffs update. In
                the upcoming update, you will find a large
                number of new features that we will tell
                you about today.<br>
                And we want to note that this update should
                be presented both for the Java version and
                for the Mobile version of the Minecraft
                game.<br>
                Please note that the release of Minecraft
                PE 1.17 will be presented to the Minecraft
                community next year, namely in the summer
                of 2021. Our team hopes that this winter we
                will see the first beta versions of this
                update.<br>
                Let's take a look at all that will be added
                to the Minecraft world in the upcoming
                Minecraft update 1.17.

                The next location is the Dripstone Cave. A
                place where you will see a lot of
                Stalagmite and Stalactite.<br>
                Stalagmite is mineral formations that grow
                from the ground. Stalactite is mineral
                formations that grow on the ceiling of a
                cave.<br>
                These formations are quite dangerous, as
                they can cause instant damage regardless of
                whether the player fell on them or they
                fell on him. Please note that water drips
                from the stalactites, which can be used to
                fill the cauldrons if they are placed under
                the stalactite.
